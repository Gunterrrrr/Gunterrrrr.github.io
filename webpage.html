    <p id="paragraph">
        Felines are popular because of their good lookings and strong fighting ability, but as predators at the top of the food chain, the survival status of felines is not as good as it should be.
    </p>
    <p id="paragraph">
        There are two families of felines: the cat subfamily and the leopard subfamily. There was once a cheetah subfamily, but now it has been merged into the cat subfamily.
    </p>
    <p id="paragraph">
        According to research, the origin of felines is in Asia, and China's feline resources are also quite rich, so how many species of felines are there in China, how are they distributed, and how do they survive?
    </p>
    <p id="paragraph">
        According to the "Zoology of China", there are more species of felines in China, among which there are golden cat genus, cat genus, lynx genus, striated cat genus, leopard cat genus and snow leopard genus in the subfamily of cats, while there are clouded leopard genus and leopard genus in the subfamily of leopards.

                <p class="card-text" id="left">The Chinese mountain cat is endemic to China and lives on the north-eastern edge of the Tibetan Plateau. It was recorded only in eastern Qinghai and north-western Sichuan. It inhabits high-elevation steppe grassland, alpine meadow, alpine shrubland and coniferous forest edges between 2,500 and 5,000 m (8,200 and 16,400 ft) elevation. It has not been confirmed in true desert or heavily forested mountains.</p>

                <p class="card-text" id="left">The Pallas's cat (Otocolobus manul), also known as the manul, is a small wild cat with long and dense light grey fur. Its rounded ears are set low on the sides of the head. Its head-and-body length ranges from 46 to 65 cm (18 to 26 in) with a 21 to 31 cm (8.3 to 12.2 in) long bushy tail. It is well camouflaged and adapted to the cold continental climate in its native range, which receives little rainfall and experiences a wide range of temperatures. The Pallas's cat has rounded rather than vertical slit pupils, a unique feature among small cats.</p>

                <p class="card-text" id="left">The Asian golden cat is polymorphic in colour. Golden, reddish brown and buff brown individuals were recorded in northeastern India and Bhutan. Reddish brown morphs were recorded in Sumatra. Melanistic individuals were recorded in the eastern Himalayas, and in Sumatra. A spotted Asian golden cat with large rosettes on shoulders, flanks and hips was described for the first time based on a specimen from China in 1872. This morph was recorded in China, Bhutan and in West Bengal's Buxa Tiger Reserve.</p>

                <p class="card-text" id="left">The Eurasian lynx has a relatively short, reddish or brown coat that is marked with black spots; their number and pattern are highly variable. The underparts, neck and chin are whitish. The fur is more brightly coloured with more numerous spots in animals living at the southern end of its range. In winter, it is much thicker and varies from silver-grey to greyish brown. Some animals have dark brown stripes on the forehead and back. It has powerful, relatively long legs, with large webbed and furred paws that act like snowshoes. It also has a short "bobbed" tail with an all-black tip, black tufts of hair on its ears, and a long grey-and-white ruff.</p>
